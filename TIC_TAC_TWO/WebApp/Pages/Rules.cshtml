                        At the start of the game, each player takes turns placing one of their pieces
                        on any empty cell contained within the tic-tac-toe grid.
                    </p>
                    <p>Once each player has placed at least two of their pieces, they may do one of three things on their turn:</p>
                    <ul class="list-group mb-4">
                        <li class="list-group-item">1. Place one of their remaining pieces on an empty cell within the grid.</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item">2. Move the tic-tac-toe grid to a new position (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item">3. Move one of their pieces already on the board to any empty cell within the grid.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The first player to create a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of their own pieces contained within the tic-tac-toe grid wins!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If the grid is moved such that it contains both a three-in-a-row of X pieces and a three-in-a-row of O pieces in a single move, the game is a tie.
                    </p>
